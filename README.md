no additional features, but I tried to get as close to responsive design as I could. It can resize down to Iphone SE with relatively no loss of functionality, just isn't that pretty.

NOTE- Was trying on a different repo to get this up with user auth and a modeling tool for Mongo, but it crashed and burned spectacularly so I scaled it back to the base requirements.
